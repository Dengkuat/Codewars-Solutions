  //?input
  //a sequence of integers / numbers


  //*info
  //a function that returs the sum of sequence of integers
  //the sequence is defined by 3 non negative values begin, end and step
  //so we have 3 input right all positive begin end and step clear
  //So if the begin calue is > than the end then the function should return 0 
  //And if the end is not the result of an integer number of steps then dont add it to the sum
